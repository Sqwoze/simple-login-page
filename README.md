## About the Project
This is a basic login page built with [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(coming soon...)].

## How It Works  

1. **User Interface:**  
   - The login page is built using HTML and styled with CSS for a clean and responsive design.  

2. **Form Structure:**  
   - The page includes input fields for **username** and **password**.  
   - A **"Login" button** is provided to submit the form.  
   - Links for **"Forgot Password"** and **"Forgot Username"** are included.  

3. **Static Behavior (Currently):**  
   - At this stage, the page does not process login credentials.  
   - Clicking the "Login" button does not perform authentication yet.  

4. **Upcoming JavaScript Implementation:**  
   - Form validation (e.g., checking empty fields).  
   - Interactive error messages for invalid input.  
   - Dynamic login handling (future integration with backend or local storage).  

This login page serves as a foundation for future enhancements with JavaScript and backend functionality.
